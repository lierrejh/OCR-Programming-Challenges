# OCR-Programming-Challenges
OCR A Level Computer Science
Tracker for the [Programming Challenges](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/260930-coding-challenges-booklet.pdf) booklet

I plan to complete all or as many as possible of the challenges as I can before the end of the year, as not only can they be asked in exams (or iterations of them) but they also give me a good view in how to systematically answer these questions under short time conditions.

The list of projects complete should follow the exact order from the contents of the OCR website top to bottom and whilst I may not have the most efficient solution, I aim to have one which can provide the highest marks possible.

## Task-List
- [ ] [Prime Factorisation](./PrimeFactorisation.py)
- [ ] Tilers mate
- [ ] The meaning of life 
- [ ] Sudoku
